# HTTP hello/goodbye world server

## Description

This simple server responds with different responses based on the URL:

`/` or `/hello` => `'Hello, world!'`

`/goodbye` => `'Goodbye, world!'`

`/hows-the-weather` => `'It's cool and rainy. :-('`

If any other URL is given, it returns a 404 with a helpful error message.

## Code Example

```
node http-hello-goodbye-world.js
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:3000/hello, or http://localhost:3000/goodbye.

## Motivation

This was written as a lab assignment for Code Fellows 401 class. The server spins up on port 3000.
